excerpt: 'HODI is a new shared task for the automatic detection of homotransphobia in Italian presented at EVALITA 2023. The challenge is organized into two subtasks: Subtask A focuses on the binary textual classification of homotransphobic tweets, while Subtask B is concerned with the identification of ”rationales” for explainability in the form of textual spans of text. We have received a total of 19 runs for Subtask A and 5 runs for Subtask B from a total of 8 participating teams from 6 different countries. We present here an overview of the HODI shared task, the datasets, the evaluation methodology, the results obtained by the participants, and a discussion of the methodology adopted by the teams.
