👩🏼‍💻 I am a first-year PhD student at Université Côte d'Azur.

🔬 My research interests are in using machines and language to have a real impact on the world.

📚 I am currently working with Natural Language Processing and Hate Speech. Specifically, how to generate counter speech to attack it.

🎈 I am also interested in promoting education through teaching at my university.
